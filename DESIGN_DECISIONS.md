# JobOps Design Decisions

## Key Architectural Choices

### 1. Modular App Architecture
- **Decision**: Separate Django apps for each domain (users, jobs, equipment, audit)
- **Rationale**: Maintainability, scalability, team development, focused testing

### 2. Custom User Model
- **Decision**: Extended AbstractUser with role-based fields
- **Rationale**: Flexibility, security, future-proof, Django best practices

### 3. JWT Authentication
- **Decision**: SimpleJWT with access/refresh tokens
- **Rationale**: Scalability, mobile support, API-first design, security

### 4. Role-Based Permissions
- **Decision**: Custom permission classes for granular access control
- **Rationale**: Security, business logic enforcement, maintainability

### 5. Background Tasks
- **Decision**: Celery with Redis for scheduled tasks
- **Rationale**: Reliability, scalability, monitoring, Django integration

### 6. RESTful API Design
- **Decision**: Django REST Framework with resource-based URLs
- **Rationale**: Standards compliance, documentation, testing, client support

### 7. Multi-layer Validation
- **Decision**: Model, serializer, and business logic validation
- **Rationale**: Data quality, security, user experience, maintainability

### 8. Audit Logging
- **Decision**: Dedicated audit app with comprehensive change tracking
- **Rationale**: Compliance, debugging, security, business intelligence

## Technology Stack Rationale

- **Django 4.2.23**: Stability, maturity, extensive ecosystem
- **DRF**: RESTful API development, serialization, authentication
- **Celery**: Background task processing, scheduling
- **Redis**: Message broker, caching, session storage
- **SQLite**: Development simplicity, PostgreSQL for production

## Future Considerations

- Real-time notifications with WebSockets
- Mobile application development
- Advanced analytics and ML integration
- Multi-tenancy support
- Third-party system integrations
